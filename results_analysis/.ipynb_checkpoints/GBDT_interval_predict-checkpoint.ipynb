    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook essentially performs fine-tuning of the final-layer of the Resnet-18 models. However, instead of directly fine-tuning the Resnet-18 models in TensorFlow, we train ridge-regression models using the extracted features. We take this approach for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is easier to perform leave-one-group-out (\"logo\") cross-validated ridge regression using scikit-learn, as opposed to TensorFlow. For out-of-country (OOC) experiments, the left-out group is the test country. For in-country experiments, the left-out group is the test split.\n",
    "2. We can concatenate the 512-dim features from the RGB/MS CNN models with the 512-dim features from the NL CNN models to form a larger 1024-dim feature vector capturing RGB/MS + NL imagery information. We do this instead of training a CNN with the MS+NL imagery stacked together as an input because we found it to result in better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the extensive cross-validation, each \"logo\" CV run may take ~2-4 hours. In total, this notebook may take upwards of 15 hours to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you complete this notebook, use the `model_analysis/dhs_ooc.ipynb` and `model_analysis/dhs_incountry.ipynb` (TODO) notebooks to analyze the final performance of the fine-tuned Resnet-18 models."
