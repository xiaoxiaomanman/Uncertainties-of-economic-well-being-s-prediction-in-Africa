    "Households surveyed by DHS and LSMS are grouped into clusters (roughly villages). Our goal is to train models to predict the average cluster wealth-index given a satellite image of the cluster. To train our models, we assign the clusters into training (`train`), validation (`val`), and test (`test`) splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do not arbitrarily assign clusters to splits because many clusters are located very close to each other such that their satellite images overlap. If one cluster was put in `train` and a nearby cluster was put into `test`, this may constitute \"peaking\" at the test set. This is not what we want. Instead, we want our model to be generalizable, able to estimate the cluster wealth-index in grographic regions that the model has not necessarily seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have to take special care that the satellite images between splits do not overlap. We do this through 2 separate approaches: \"out-of-country\" and \"in-country\". For \"**out-of-country**\" splits, we assign entire countries to a split, so naturally there is no overlap between splits. For \"**in-country**\" splits, we allow different clusters within the same country to be assigned to different splits, taking care that their satellite images have no overlap. **The point of this notebook is to create the in-country splits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the survey data is fairly limited (~20K DHS clusters, ~3K LSMS clusters), we actually use cross-validated training. We assign the clusters to 1 of 5 folds labeled `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']` such that the folds are non-overlapping. Given the 5 folds, we create 5 different sets of train/val/test splits, where each set is labeled by the name of its `test` fold:\n",

Thus, we try to convert 6.72km to degrees (lat, lon).\n",
